## About SD Elements ##

SD Elements is a platform that translates policies to prescriptive, measurable procedures that are used by IT and Engineering teams to achieve their security and compliance objectives. SD Elements generates and tracks granular controls with a flexible rule-based engine and integrates those controls into ALMs and enterprise workflows used by development teams, including those leveraging DevOps. The platform provides an accurate view into the risk and compliance status of applications in development.

## SD Elements Azure Pipelines Extension ##

The SD Elements Azure Pipelines Extension is an SD Elements Integration that allows enterprises
to add a security gate to their DevOps cycle. The plugin will allow users to add a build task to pass/fail pipelines, based on the compliance status to a given project's risk policy.
